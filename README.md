## Projects 📂

Here's a list of projects available in this repository:

1. **01-Movies** - The objective of this application is to allow users to search for movies and obtain relevant information about them, such as the title, year, and poster. It utilizes the OMDb API to make search requests and retrieve the corresponding results.
2. **02-ecommerce** - This is an Ecommerce application that displays a list of products obtained from an API endpoint. It allows filtering the products by category and price. It utilizes the React context (`useContext`) to avoid passing unnecessary props.
3. **03-addintech** - Application that displays a list of products fetched from a database through a REST API to showcase cataloged products. This application uses libraries such as ReactJS, NextUI, and ReduxToolkit. It also includes a CRUD panel to manage the offered products.
